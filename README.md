More about the BrainCraft HAT

The idea behind the BrainCraft HAT is that you’d be able to “craft brains” for Machine Learning on the EDGE,

with Microcontrollers & Microcomputers.

On ASK AN ENGINEER, our founder & engineer chatted with Pete Warden, the technical lead of the mobile,
embedded TensorFlow Group on Google’s Brain team about what would be ideal for a board like this.

And here’s what we designed! The BrainCraft HAT has a
- 240×240 TFT IPS display for inference output,
- slots for camera connector cable for imaging projects,
- a 5-way joystick,
- button for UI input,
- left and right microphones,
- stereo headphone out,
- stereo 1 W speaker out,
- three RGB DotStar LEDs,
- two 3 pin STEMMA connectors on PWM pins so they can drive NeoPixels or servos,
- and Grove/STEMMA/Qwiic I2C port.

This will let people build a wide range of audio/video AI projects
while also allowing easy plug-in of sensors and robotics!
A controllable mini fan attaches to the bottom
and can be used to keep your Pi cool while doing intense AI inference calculations.

Most importantly,
there’s an On/Off switch that will completely disable the audio codec,
so that when it's off there’s no way it's listening to you.

Features:

1.54" IPS TFT display with 240x240 resolution that can show text or video
Stereo speaker ports for audio playback - either text-to-speech, alerts, or for creating a voice assistant.
Stereo headphone out for audio playback through a stereo system, headphones, or powered speakers.
Stereo microphone input - perfect for making your very own smart home assistants
Two 3-pin JST STEMMA connectors that can be used to connect more buttons, a relay, or even some NeoPixels!
STEMMA QT plug-and-play I2C port, can be used with any of our 50+ I2C STEMMA QT boards,
or can be used to connect to Grove I2C devices with an adapter cable.
5-Way Joystick + Button for user interface and control.
Three RGB DotStar LEDs for colorful LED feedback.
The STEMMA QT port means you can attach heat image sensors like the Panasonic Grid-EYE or MLX90640.
Heat-Sensitive cameras can be used as a person detector,
even in the dark! An external accelerometer can be attached for gesture or vibration sensing
such as machinery/industrial predictive maintenance projects.
